# Improving Visual Question Answering(VQA) Models Using Semantic Analysis and Active Learning Using Pytorch
- Network function virtualization (NFV) is referred to the technology in which softwarized network functions virtually run on commodity servers. Such functions are called virtual network functions (VNFs). One of challenges is to meet the reliability requirement of the requested services considering the reliability of the commodity servers.
- To address such an issue, in this paper, we employ Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL) to model NFV placement problem considering the reliability requirement of the services.
- Numerical evaluations show that the introduced model can significantly improve the performance of the network operator.
